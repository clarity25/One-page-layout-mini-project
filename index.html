          <h2>Anime-based excursions are growing in popularity in Japan, and here are 10 must-visit real-world places seen in your favorite anime!</h2>

          <p id="homep">"Anime Pilgrimage" is a term that not all fans may be acquainted with, but it’s something every anime fan should try out for themselves given the time and money. It's basically all about fans visiting real-life locations that their favorite anime were either inspired by or directly based in.

          This can range from big cities like Tokyo and Kyoto to smaller urban areas spread out across Japan. The locations can be general or incredibly specific. It’s a cool way of seeing and experiencing the country while being to appreciate their pop culture. These locations are an absolute must for any hardcore anime fan. On the other hand, you should check them out regardless of whether or not you’ve seen them on Toonami or Crunchyroll.</p>

          <p>Spirited Away is one of the most well-known anime films out there. Many fans saw it while they were getting into anime, and, as a result, it’s left a pretty big mark on people. One location in the film, the Dōgo Onsen, has become a particularly popular pilgrimage site.

          The onsen is located on the island of Shikoku in the south of Japan. You’ll find it in the city of Matsuyama. After taking some pictures, be sure to go and take a nice bath.</p>

          <p>Yakushima is a beautiful island that isn’t necessarily the most easily accessible on this list, but a great place to visit regardless. The island served as the inspiration for the forest area in Princess Mononoke.

            The island is beautiful and perfect for those who like to see and explore the outdoors on vacation. Japan has a lot of unique and beautiful landscapes, and what you’ll find in Yakushima really highlights that.</p>
